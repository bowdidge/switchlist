This is an alternate switchlist style for the Mac SwitchList application,

This draws freight car switchlists in the style of a pile of waybills
that a conductor would carry.  The waybills are inspired by Tony
Thompson's articles on waybills:

The iPhone version uses swipes to switch between waybills.

The swiping code is based on SwipeView by Matteo Spinnelli.

This is a work-in-progress.
