This directory contains examples of custom switchlists you can add to
SwitchList, and shows how you could create your own switchlist style and
have SwitchList find it.  To install the Thomas example or any custom
switchlist style:

* If necessary, create a SwitchList directory in your Library/Application 
  Support directory.  In the Finder, choose "Home" from the "Go" menu to open
  a window showing your current "home directory" where all your files live.
  Open the Library folder, then the Application Support folder.  If there
  is no SwitchList folder inside your Application Support folder, create one.

* Copy the Thomas directory into the SwitchList folder in Application Support.

* Run SwitchList.  "Thomas" should now be one choice for a switchlist style.
