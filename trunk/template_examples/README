This directory contains examples of custom switchlists you can add to
SwitchList, and shows how you could create your own switchlist style and
have SwitchList find it.  To install the Thomas example or any custom
switchlist style:

* Launch SwitchList.

* Choose the "Import Template..." menu item.  In the Open File dialog box,
  select the directory containing the template you want.  (That's the 
  containing folder - the "Thomas" folder that contains the switchlist.html
  file that contains the actual details on the switchlist style.

* Go to the Preferences dialog box, found under the SwitchList menu. 
  The template you imported should now be one of the choices.
