This is a simple template that only includes a single HTML file for
showing switchlists.  If there was an iPhone-specific version, you would
have seen a separate switchlist-iphone.html file in this directory.

The top of the Thomas switchlist style includes CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
information for setting the default font typeface and size.  Everything in
the body is simple HTML used to draw the switchlist.

Note how template variables (like {{train.name}}) is used to print specific
values for the switchlist being drawn.  Also see how

  {% for ca in train.allFreightCarsInVisitOrder %}
 
is used to draw each freight car's line in order.  This switchlist uses
an ordered list (with the <OL>) tag to give us the numbered entries; most
switchlists will instead want to use an HTML table (either with or without
borders) to show columns for each particular kind of information.
