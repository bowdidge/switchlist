Vasona Branch

This is my model railroad; it models a Southern Pacific branch in San
Jose, CA.  Most of the industries are canneries.  There are two major
staging yards on each end, several towns in-between, and an
interchange track for the Western Pacific (which is modeled as if it
were a staging yard.)

for more details on the railroad, towns, and industries.  The track plan
may help you understand the SwitchList layout configuration.
