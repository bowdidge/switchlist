Sample layout based on "Moving Freight around Chicago in N scale", in
November 2012 Model Railroader magazine.

This layout represents a Chicago-area switching layout containing trackage
for two belt lines: the Belt Railway of Chicago (BRC) and Baltimore and Ohio
Chicago Terminal (B&OCT).  The BRC runs from Clearing Yard to the 16th Street
Yard near the Western Electric Hawthorne Works, and on to an interchange
with the B&OCT I informally named "Chicago Jct."  The B&OCT, running slightly
farther outside of Chicago, runs from Barr Yard through Robey Yard, and
meets the BRC at Chicago Jct.  On the actual layout, Barr and Clearing Yards
share a single two-ended staging yard.

Note how Chicago Jct's interchange track is set up to allow both railroads
to exchange cars with each other.  Also, watch how cars go from the Santa
Fe interchange on the B&OCT, through the interchange, and on to Western
Electric.  Also note that both major railroad interchanges (Chicago and North
Western and Santa Fe) both are set up as yards so empty cars will be returned
to those interchange tracks.
