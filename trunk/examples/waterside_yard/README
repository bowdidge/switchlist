Waterside Yard

This layout is based on an example from Iain Rice's "Waterside Yard"
track plan in his book "Small, Smart, & Practical Track Plans"
published by Kalmbach Publishing in 2000.  This demonstration layout
is based on on a track plan that had a large midwestern rail yard, a
branch going to staging, and east and west traffic going to staging.

This switchlist file shows how through trains can be set up, and how
to use divisions to get cars routed the correct ways.
