This example switch list layout simulates the switching railroad in a
Stockton, CA industrial development.  The railroad interchanges on the
west with the Southern Pacific and on the east with the Western
Pacific.  The industrial area has a western area ("West Industries"),
eastern area ("East Industries"), and yard between the two.

Two versions exist for this layout, "Stockton with Divisions" that
uses divisions so that WP cars exit through the west yard and SP cars
SPand foreign cars through the east, and another "Stockton Example"
which allows cars to exit via either yard.

There is one train, a daily switching run that goes from the yard to
the west industries, then to the SP interchange, then to the east
industries, and finally to the WP interchange before returning to the
yard.

The cargos have most of the traffic going via the SP, with a few going
via the WP.  This is prototypical; most shippers sent occasional loads
through the WP to encourage competition, but sent the bulk of their
loads through the SP.

Note that the foreign boxcars are associated with the East division,
which are handled by the SP interchange.  This special division
ensures these boxcars are used only for the produce leaving the West
Warehouse.  The incoming cans come from the SP, so only SP boxcars
will carry them.
