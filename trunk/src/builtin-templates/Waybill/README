Waybill switchlist style
Robert Bowdidge, April 11, 2012

This is an alternate switchlist style for the Mac SwitchList application,

This draws freight car switchlists in the style of a pile of waybills
that a conductor would carry.  The waybills are inspired by Tony
Thompson's articles on waybills:

The iPhone version uses swipes to switch between waybills.

The swiping code is based on SwipeView by Matteo Spinnelli.

This is a work-in-progress.

To see an example, open waybillExample.html in your web browser.

To install the Waybill switchlist style and try it out in SwitchList:

* If necessary, create a SwitchList folder in your Library/Application
  Support folder.  In the Finder, choose "Home" from the "Go" menu to open
  a window showing your current "home directory" where all your files live.
  Open the Library folder, then the Application Support folder.  If there
  is no SwitchList folder inside your Application Support folder, create one.

* Copy the Waybill folder for the custom switchlist template into the
  SwitchList folder in Application Support.  You should have a Waybill
  folder inside the SwitchList folder, and the Waybill folder should 
  contain the switchlist.html file and switchlist-iphone.html file.

* Run SwitchList.  Your new custom switchlist template should now be one choic\
e for a switchlist style.
