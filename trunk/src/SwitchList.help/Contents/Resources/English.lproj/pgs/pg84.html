This layout represents a Chicago-area switching layout containing trackage
for two belt lines: the Belt Railway of Chicago (BRC) and Baltimore and Ohio
Chicago Terminal (B&amp;OCT). 
<p>
This layout is based on the layout plan in "Moving Freight around Chicago in N scale", which appeared
in the
November 2012 Model Railroader magazine.
<p>
The BRC runs from Clearing Yard to the 16th Street
Yard near the Western Electric Hawthorne Works, and on to an interchange
with the B&amp;OCT I informally named "Chicago Jct."  The B&amp;OCT, running slightly
farther outside of Chicago, runs from Barr Yard through Robey Yard, and
meets the BRC at Chicago Jct.  On the actual layout, Barr and Clearing Yards
share a single two-ended staging yard.
<p>
Key details to check out on this layout:
<ul>
<li>Note how Chicago Jct's interchange track is set up to allow both railroads
to exchange cars with each other.
<li>Watch how cars go from the Santa Fe interchange on the B&amp;OCT,
through the interchange, and on to Western
Electric.
<li>Note that both major railroad interchanges (Chicago and North
Western and Santa Fe) both are set up as yards so empty cars will be returned to the interchange
tracks.
<li>For both of the intermediate yards (Robey and 16th Street), separate towns were used for the
yard and for the nearby industries.  This will make it easier to do transfer runs from staging to
the yards, and have a separate yard job switching nearby industries.
</ul>
