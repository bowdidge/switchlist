You can also find information about your
layout from the Reports menu.  Make sure the main window describing
your layout is active, and choose a report from the report menu.
<p>
The reports, ordered in terms of how much I use them, are:
<ul>
<li>
Industry Report
<p>
This report lists each industry (sorted by town), and lists the cars
currently at each.  I use this report to make sure all cars are in
their proper place before an operating session.
</p>
<li>
Yard Report
<p>
This report lists all cars in each yard, and what train they'll be
assigned to.  I use it to set up the trains in staging, or use it as a
switch list for a yard crew sorting cars.
</p>
<li>
Car Report
<p>
This report lists all cars in alphabetical order, its current
location, and contents.  It's handy for getting a single list showing
where all the cars are.
</p>
<li>
Reserved Car Report
<p>
This report lists all cars that have a cargo assigned, and notes the
origin and destination of the contained cargo.  It's useful for
understanding where cars are moving and why.
</p>
<li>
Cargo Report
<p>
This report analyzes the list of cargos, and shows for each industry
and car type how many loads are expected to arrive and depart from the
industry.  I use it to make sure that the each industry really is
generating the proportion of cargo I expect.

</ul>
