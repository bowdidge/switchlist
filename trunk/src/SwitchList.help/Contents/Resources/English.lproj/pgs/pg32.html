Choosing all the potential cargos for industries on your layout can be
the hardest part of using SwitchList.  The Suggest Cargos dialog box
(available from the Report menu) allows SwitchList to suggest potential
cargos for each industry.
<p>

To get suggestions for cargos, select the "Suggest Cargos..." menu item to
show the Suggest Cargos dialog box.
At the top of the dialog box, change the drop-down menu to the industry
for which you want to create cargos.  SwitchList will guess at the
possible kind of industry based on the name, and list that guess in the
"Industry Category" menu.  (Click on the menu if it chose wrong; SwitchList's
best guesses are at the top of the menu, followed by all the other possible
industries that SwitchList can provide hints for.)
<p>
Once you've selected an industry category, SwitchList provides a short
list of potential cargos, and the likely cars per week based on your
suggested total number of cars per week the industry should get.
For each potential
cargo, SwitchList shows a checkbox to indicate whether you want that cargo
created, whether it is shipped by or received by the industry, the name of the
cargo, likely cars per week, and preferred place where the cargo should
be coming from or going to.
<p>
Below the list of potential cargos, you'll see a grayed-out list of the
current set of cargos that the industry ships and receives, helping you know
which potential cargos might be duplicates.
<p>
Decide for each cargo whether you want that cargo, and check or uncheck the
"Keep" checkbox appropriately.  Also, change the location of where you'd
like the car to be coming from or going to, adjust the name, and adjust the
rate of cars per week that should be shipped or received.
<p>
Pressing "Create Cargos" will cause the selected cargos to be created and
put into the list of cargos available on your railroad.
