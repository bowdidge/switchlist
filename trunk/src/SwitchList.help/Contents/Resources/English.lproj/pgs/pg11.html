There's a few nice switchlist generation programs available for
home computers.  Most were designed for large layouts and clubs, and
require lots of work to set up.

SwitchList wants to be different.  It's designed to give people
with smaller layouts an easy way to begin operations.  Although SwitchList
might be useful for larger layouts, making life easier for small layout
owners is our primary goal.

So is SwitchList right for your layout?

<h2>Shelf Layout With Fiddle Yard?</h2>
If you have a small shelf layout with only a fiddle yard or interchange
track, SwitchList will work fine.  Treat your interchange track like a
staging yard.  When you prepare a train to depart from the staging yard,
set the assigned cars on the interchange track, print a switchlist, and 
bring the train onto the visible layout.  When the train finishes, put the
cars away and prepare for tomorrow's session which will have a random
and different set of cars and industries to switch.

<h2>Layout With Staging Yards and No On-Layout Yard?</h2>
You'll have a great time with SwitchList on this kind of layout.
Before each session, set up each train in staging to match the switchlists.
During the session, pull the trains out of staging, and switch industries.
On return, you're done.  Tomorrow's session will involve different cars
and different train lengths.
<p>
See the <a href="pg81">Vasona Branch example layout</a> or
<a href="pg80.html">Stockton example layout</a> to see how these kinds of
layouts can be set up.

<h2>Layouts with Staging Yards and On-Layout Yard</h2>
SwitchList isn't as helpful when you have a layout requiring significant
switching.  SwitchList's main constraint is that you aren't required to
specify the order that trains arrive and leave, so it can be hard to
predict what cars might come from an earlier train and be switched to a later
train.
<p>
One way to work around this is to break your operating session into two
halves.  Imagine you've got a staging yard Alpha, an on-layout yard Bravo,
and an industry at Charlie.
You can set up trains that go from Alpha to Bravo, and trains that go from
Bravo to Charlie.  Now, you can take a car from Alpha to Bravo on one train,
and from Bravo to Charlie on the second.
<p>
SwitchList, as it is today, doesn't work well for this model because it
wants each car to be handled once during an operating session.
To make this work in SwitchList, you could break your operating session
into a first half and second half.  At the end of the first session, press
the "Start New Session" button in the overview tab to end the session and
create new cars and cargos.  Cars that had come from A to B and are now in
the yard will be re-assigned to the train from B to C for final delivery.
Your yard crew will need to sort cars and makeup trains before trains can
depart.
<p>
See the <a href="pg81.html">Waterside Yard example layout</a> and
<a href="pg83.html">Oakland Repair Depot example layouts</a>
to see how these kinds of
layouts can be set up.

<h2>Layouts with Large On-Layout Yards</h2>
If you have a very large On-Layout Yard that does classification, you
probably don't want SwitchList or another switchlist generator because
most switchlist generators won't let you sort the yard based on anything
other than strict instructions.
<p>
For such layouts, I find <a href="http://www.tulsanmra.org/resources/DRS_CardCards.pdf">Car Cards</a> a better approach.  With Car Cards, you use a paper
card to represent each freight car.  When you assign a cargo to that car,
you paperclip a separate paper describing the load, the source, and the
destination.  For large layouts, Car Cards can be really handy because
a switch crew can simply grab a yard track full of cars, check out their
next destinations on the car card, and sort the cars into trains.  When
they're done sorting, they make the cars into a train and give the
cards to the crew that will switch the cars.  If the yard's switch crew
works too slow, that's ok too - the train can leave with whatever cars
are sorted.
<p>
If you have ideas on how to make SwitchList more useful for larger layouts,
drop me a note.
