I designed SwitchList for my own layout.  Other, similar layouts should
find SwitchList just right.  If your layout is smaller and focused on switching,
does not have a large, busy yard, or has few timetable-based freights,
you may also find it useful.
<p>
Although SwitchList could work for layouts with large yards,
the current yard reports are probably insufficient to help a yard crew
know how to sort and organize cars in the yard.
<p>
Similarly, although SwitchList can handle through trains stopping at a
yard, SwitchList would not easily handle cases where cars need to be
switched between through trains.
<p>
If you have ideas on how to make SwitchList more useful for larger layouts,
drop me a note.
