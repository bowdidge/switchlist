Towns represent major areas on your layout, and help your train crew
know where they're going.  If the location isn't on the visible layout,
then you can mark a town as "in staging".

Towns in staging are special because if a freight car arrives at a
yard in that town and is destined for any offline place,
then the car is treated as if it
arrived at its final destination.
In effect, once the freight car goes off the visible layout, then
any stop it makes should unload it and send it off on its next journey.
<p>
This isn't true for cargos with a destination at an industry in staging.
Cars destined for a "staging" town will still be switched as if on the
visible portion of the layout.  Place industries in staging only if you
want cars spotted at a specific track in staging.  You can also set a cargo's source
or destination to a yard in staging if you want to ensure cars carrying that cargo always
go to a specific staging yard.
