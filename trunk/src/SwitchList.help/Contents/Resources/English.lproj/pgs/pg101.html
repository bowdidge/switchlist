Towns represent major areas on your layout, and help your train crew
know where they're going.  If the location isn't on the visible layout,
then you can mark a town as "in staging".

Towns in staging are special because if a freight car arrives at a
yard in that town and is destined for any other non-visible place on the layout
(either a town represented by staging or a town that's offline),
then the car is treated as if it
arrived at its final destination.
<p>
In effect, once the freight car goes off the visible layout, then
any stop it makes should unload it and send it off on its next journey.
