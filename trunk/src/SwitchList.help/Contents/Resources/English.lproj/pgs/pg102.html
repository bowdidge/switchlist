Towns represent major areas on your layout, and help your train crew
know where they're going.  If the location doesn't exist and trains
can't reach it, then you can mark a town as "offline".
<p>
Offline towns are special because any freight car reaching <i>any</i> staging yard is assumed to have reached the offline town,
and can be immediately loaded or unloaded.
Place industries in offline towns so that you can have realistic and interesting
destinations for freight cars.  Routing cars to "New York", "Chicago", or "Toledo" is
much more interesting than declaring the cars are only going to the "offline east staging yard."
