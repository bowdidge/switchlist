Towns represent major areas on your layout, and help your train crew
know where they're going.  If the location doesn't exist and trains
can't reach it, then you can mark a town as "offline".

Offline towns are special because trains can never be directed as running
through those towns, and a freight car reaching staging but destined
for an industry in an offline town is assumed to have arrived.
