This layout is based on an example from Iain
Rice's "Waterside Yard" track plan in his book
"Small, Smart, and Practical Track Plans"
published by Kalmbach Publishing in 2000.  This
demonstration layout is based on on a track plan that had a large
midwestern rail yard, a branch going to staging, and east and west
traffic going to staging.

This switchlist file shows how through trains can be set up, and how
to use divisions to get cars routed the correct ways.
