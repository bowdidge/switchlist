The Towns tab lets you name the places on your layout that trains visit.
<p>
To add a new town, press the "Add" button and provide the named
fields.  To remove an existing town, select it and press the "Remove"
button. 
<p>
Each town is associated with three pieces of information:
its name, whether the town represents a place in staging (off the visible layout), and whether the town represents an offline location (imaginary place a train cannot visit.)
<p>
Towns represent places on the layout; they can be as large or small as you want, but generally you want a town to represent an area of your layout that your operators can identify.  If they are told that an industry is in "Cucamonga",
they should have a good chance to figure out what part of the layout
counts as Cucamonga.
<p>
Layouts are only important to SwitchList as places trains visit, and as
areas holding industries.  It's fine to create separate towns for areas
close together and part of the same urban area.
