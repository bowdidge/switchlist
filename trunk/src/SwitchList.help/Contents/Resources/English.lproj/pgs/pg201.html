Some folks might not
like the default font choices for switchlists.  If you have access to
a font that looks like a dirty teletype printer's output, you might
prefer that to the standard Courier font used in the typewritten
switchlists.
<p>
You can change the font choices
from the Mac's command line.  Launch the terminal program, then type a
command like this all on one line to change the default typewriter
font.  Substitute "Courier" with the name of your preferred font in
quotes.  The font needs to be installed on your Mac; to test, start up
TextEdit, type some text, and try to change the font to your preferred
font.  The double quotes around the name are needed if the font name
has spaces in it.
<pre>defaults write
com.blogspot.vasonabranch.SwitchListApp SwitchListTypedFontName
"Courier"</pre>
Here's the same command for changing the handwritten font choice.
<pre>
defaults write com.blogspot.vasonabranch.SwitchListApp 
SwitchListHandwritingFontName "Comic Sans"</pre>
<p>
If the font named isn't found, SwitchList will default to the standard
fonts - Courier for typewritten switchlists, and "Handwriting -
Dakota" for handwritten switchlists.
<p>
To see what fonts are available on your computer, run any text editor
(such as TextEdit.app, found in the Applications folder), and try changing
the font of text.  If the text editor sees the font, SwitchList ought to.
<p>
You can also install other fonts.  For that 1950's teletype feeling,
try Vic Fieger's
<A HREF="http://www.dafont.com/carbontype.font">CarbonType</a> font.
To use this (or any other downloaded font),
download the file, and uncompress the download to find the file
with a ttf or other font extension.  Open to your home directory, open your
Library folder and the Fonts folder inside it, and drop the font file in.
You'll need to restart any running programs (such as SwitchList) before
they can see the new font.
