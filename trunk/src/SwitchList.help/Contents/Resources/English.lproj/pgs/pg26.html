The Towns tab lets you name the trains that run on your layout.
Only trains that handle freight cars need to be named.
Once you have added a train, you can generate a switchlist for that train.
<p>
To add a new train, press the "Add" button and provide the named
fields.  To remove an existing train, select it and press the "Remove"
button. 
<p>
Each train is associated with three pieces of information:
a name for the train, the kinds of freight cars it may carry, and
the towns it will visit during its run.
Any of these values can be changed at any time.
<p>
To switch the kind of freight cars taken by the train, press the "Change cars accepted..." button.  This raises a dialog box listing all the car types
known to SwitchList, and lets you select any or all of the car types
as carried by the train.  If no car types are selected,
SwitchList assumes the train can carry any kind of car.
<p>
To switch the towns the train visits, press the "Change stops..." button.  This
raises a dialog box letting you list the towns visited in order.
Trains must start and end in a town with a yard, and can only visit
towns in visible portions of the layout or in staging.
If the train goes out and back, make sure to list the stations visited in each
direction.
