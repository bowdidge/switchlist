My layout is in a garage, but my Macintosh is inside.  Whenever I set
up an operating session, I have to print out the various reports and
carry them out to the garage to check that cars are in the correct
locations, and if they're not, I need to march back into the house to
change the car locations.
<p>
The View Switchlists on iPad feature gives me a way to avoid wasting paper
and waiting for the printer to finish when I need the various reports.

<A HREF="../../shrd/switchlist_webserver.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/switchlist_webserver.jpg"></a>Turning this feature on in the Preferences dialog box ("Display Web Server
Control Panel") displays a new "Web Server" panel whenever SwitchList is
running.  In this panel, you'll see a control for enabling and disabling
web access, and the web address for viewing switch lists when SwitchList
is running.   This server can only display
SwitchList data.  By connecting to the web site that it names from an
iPad or other computer on the same home network, you can view the
trains and freight cars on your layout.
<P>
This feature is experimental.  You can currently view switchlists, view 
car locations, and change car locations.  It will not yet let you declare
a train complete.
<p>
Let me know if you find this feature interesting, or have ideas for
other cool features for SwitchList!
