The Layout tab lets you provide details about the layout as a whole.
This includes the layout name (used as the railroad name when printing
switchlists and reports), the fictional date of your operating session (again
for switchlists and reports), controls for optional features of SwitchList,
and the list of freight car types and abbreviations used on the layout.
<h2>Layout Options</h2>
<p>
SwitchList has two optional features that you can enable and disable.  You can
allow certain industries to have a set of doors and require spotting at specific doors,
and you can set siding lengths to avoid overflowing a siding.
<p>
The <b>Spot Cars at Specific Doors</b> option controls whether
industries on your layout can declare that freight cars must be spotted
at a particular door or location at an industry.  If this option is off,
then all the door-related user interface will be hidden, and door assignments
will not be printed on switchlists.  If this option
is on, then the door-related user interface in the Industries tab will
be visible, and you can decide which industries have specific
spotting rules.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Limit Industry Capacity And Train Length</b> option controls whether SwitchList limits the
number of cars going to any particular industry track.  When on, SwitchList will not send cars
to a siding unless space is available at the siding.
<p>
<h2>Freight Car Types</h2>
<p>
The Freight Car Types portion of the window lets you declare the different
car type abbreviations used on the switchlists, and what each abbreviation
represents.  SwitchList, by default, uses AAR-style car type codes, but you
can delete the existing car types and use your own instead.
