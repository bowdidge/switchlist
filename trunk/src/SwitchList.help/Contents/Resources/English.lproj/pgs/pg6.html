<H2>Stockton</h2>
<p>
<A HREF="../../shrd/stockton_schematic.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/stockton_schematic.jpg"></a>
This example switch list layout simulates the
switching railroad in a Stockton, CA industrial development.  The
railroad interchanges on the west with the Southern Pacific and on the
east with the Western Pacific.  The industrial area has a western area
("West Industries"), eastern area ("East Industries"), and yard
between the two.
<p>
Two versions exist for this layout, "Stockton with Divisions" that
uses divisions so that WP cars exit through the west yard and SP cars
and foreign cars through the east, and another "Stockton Example"
which allows cars to exit via either yard.
<p>
There is one train, a daily switching run that goes from the yard to
the west industries, then to the SP interchange, then to the east
industries, and finally to the WP interchange before returning to the
yard.
<p>
The cargos have most of the traffic going via the SP, with a few going
via the WP.  This is prototypical; most shippers sent occasional loads
through the WP to encourage competition, but sent the bulk of their
loads through the SP.
<p>
Note that the foreign boxcars are associated with the East division,
which are handled by the SP interchange.  This special division
ensures these boxcars are used only for the produce leaving the West
Warehouse.  The incoming cans come from the SP, so only SP boxcars
will carry them.
<p>
<H2>Vasona Branch</h2> 
<p>
<A HREF="../../shrd/vasona_lower.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/vasona_lower.jpg"></a>
This is my model railroad; it models a Southern Pacific branch in San
Jose, CA.  Most of the industries are canneries.  There are two major
staging yards on each end, several towns in-between, and an
interchange track for the Western Pacific (which is modeled as if it
were a staging yard.)

<p>
<h2>Waterside Yard</h2> 
<p>
This layout is based on an example from Iain
Rice's "Waterside Yard" track plan in his book "Small, Smart, &
Practical Track Plans" published by Kalmbach Publishing in 2000.  This
demonstration layout is based on on a track plan that had a large
midwestern rail yard, a branch going to staging, and east and west
traffic going to staging.
<p>
This switchlist file shows how through trains can be set up, and how
to use divisions to get cars routed the correct ways.
