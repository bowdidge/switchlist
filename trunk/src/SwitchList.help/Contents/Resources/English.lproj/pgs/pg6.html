SwitchList comes with five sample layouts to help illustrate how you might
use SwitchList.  The four examples are:
<ul>
<li><A HREF="pg80.html">Stockton and Stockton With Divisions</a>
<p>
These two examples show how divisions can be used to route cars for two
different railroads off the layout in two directions.
<li><a href="pg81.html">Vasona Branch</a>
<p>
My personal layout, and an example of a large, realistic setup in SwitchList.
<li><a href="pg82.html">Waterside Yard</a>
<p>
Example of a large layout with through trains and a branch line.
<li><a href="pg83.html">Oakland</a>
<p>
Defines separate Towns for different areas of one physical town on the layout.
By dividing the physical town into three towns for SwitchList, particular
areas of the town can be served by specific trains.a
