Figuring out where freight cars should go...
<p>
Each car can belong to a division which is used to identify where the
empty car is supposed to go, as well as which industries prefer that
car.

Divisions are completely optional; SwitchList should work just fine if
you never fill in the Division fields in industries, or the Home
Division field in freight cars.  Divisions can be as simple as “Here”
and “Elsewhere” to indicate which boxcars are for the local railroad
and which are for everyone else, or could indicate the owning
railroad.  I usually treat the division as either a specific railroad
or region of the country.
<p>
Divisions give you a way to restrict what cars get used.  For example,
bagged cement going from a cement plant on your layout (in the "SP"
division) to an offline west-coast industry also in the "SP" division
would only get assigned to cars in the division of one of the
industries.  An "East Coast" car shouldn't be used for this shipment,
but canned fruit going to an offline industry in the "East Coast"
division is appropriate.
