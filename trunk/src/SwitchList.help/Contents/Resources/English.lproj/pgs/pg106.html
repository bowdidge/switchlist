Interchanges in U.S. railroad terminology refer to tracks joining two
railroads that were an official hand-off point for trading cars
destined for the other railroad.  Cars at an interchange track between
railroads A and B could be empties heading home (which were usually
handed off from railroad A to railroad B as soon as possible so
railroad B paid to move it), or loaded freight cars going to an
industry on the other railroad or a railroad further in that direction
(which were usually handed off by railroad A to railroad B as close to
the destination as possible so that railroad A would get paid for a
larger fraction of the total freight fee).  Interchanges could be
several tracks in a yard-like configuration near a well-maintained
railroad crossing, or could have been as simple as a weedy spur joined
by short track to both railroads.

Interchanges in SwitchList are just yards that are explicitly set up
to only serve either empty freight cars from another railroad or
handle full railroad cars intended for a (real or imagined) industry
whose on that railroad.  You indicate the owning railroad by setting
the "division" for a freight car, industry, or yard.  (Whenever you
see "division", think "owning railroad"; I just used the term
"division" when I first wrote SwitchList because another program I was
using used that term.)

For example, on my Vasona Branch layout in the download, the WP
Interchange yard handles a real interchange track between the Southern
Pacific and Western Pacific.  This track is a suitable exit for empty
WP boxcars returning home, and it's also a suitable place for any
boxcar carrying cargo intended for a WP customer to exit the layout.
I indicate WP Interchange's special status by setting its division to
"WP", and stating that the yard "accepts divisions" (will accept cars
going to) the "WP" division.  All the WP freight cars have their
division set to WP.  I could also have specific imaginary industries
in staging in the WP division, though the Vasona Branch example only
directs cars to the WP Interchange as if it were just another
industry.  With this setup, empty WP boxcars go to the WP interchange
(unless they get to the San Jose Yard first, which is assumed to have
other ways to get WP boxcars home).  There's also some cargos intended
for the WP interchange explicitly that will go there as a potential
destination.
