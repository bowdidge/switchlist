<h1>Moving Cars Only If Space At Industry</h1>

<p>
On smaller model railroad layouts, model railroad operations is usually busy, and sidings are often close to overflowing.
If too many freight cars get directed at an overflowing siding, operators will get frustrated trying to figure out where
to place cars, and the realism of operations may suffer.
</p>
<p>
SwitchList has an optional feature where you can specify the length of each siding, then request that cars only be sent to a
siding if space exists for the incoming car.  If the siding would overflow, SwitchList holds the car at the previous yard or siding
until the next operating session.    SwitchList's algorithm only ensures that the siding will not be overflowing at the
end of the operating session, and so does not require trains to switch towns in a specific order.
</p>
<p>
You do not need to specify siding lengths at first, nor are you ever required to do.
SwitchList's algorithm only limits cars going to sidings with lengths specified; sidings
with a length of zero will accept all cars.  You can slowly set siding lengths, and adjust your cargos to make sure
no siding is requesting more cars than it can hold.  You also can leave the option off completely and not worry about
recording the siding lengths and car lengths required for this option.
</p>
<h2>Teaching SwitchList About Siding Lengths</h2>
<p>
Having SwitchList avoid overflowing sidings requires three steps:
<ul>
<li>Turn on the siding length option in the <A HREF="pg23.html">Layout Tab</a>.
<LI>Tell SwitchList about the lengths of each freight car.  Rough measurements are probably fine - '40' for a forty foot car.
You shouldn't need to include coupler lengths.
<LI>Measure each siding, and tell SwitchList its length.  You can do this slowly over time, measuring each siding with a scale
ruler or estimating based on the number of cars that can fit on the siding.  A siding that hold three 40 foot boxcars can
be assumed to be 120 feet long.
<li>Simulate operating sessions for your layout, and check the <A HREF="pg31.html">Problems Window</a> for
warnings about cars that can't be moved.  Check your list of cargos for the full siding; often, a three car siding
might actually be scheduled for 35 cars per week or 5 cars per day.  Adjust the arriving and departing cargos for
these overflowing sidings.
</ul>
<p>
Once you've completed this setup, normal operations should never have overflowing sidings.
There are cases where the order of trains might matter; SwitchList only keeps track of the number of cars that would be at the
siding at the end of the operating session.  If one train is picking up cars and one dropping off, a siding may temporarily
overflow if the dropping-off train arrives first.  In these cases, do what the real railroad does, and "off-spot" the car at a
nearby location temporarily.
