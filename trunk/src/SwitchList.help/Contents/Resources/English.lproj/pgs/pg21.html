The Freight Car tab lets you add new freight cars and edit details
about existing freight cars.  You'll describe the car - the car
number, its current cargo, its current location, and what kind of
freight car it is - here.  To change information on a freight car,
select that car from the list, and edit in the fields at the bottom of
the screen.
<p>
To add a new freight car, press the "Add" button and provide the named
fields.  To remove an existing freight car, select it and press the "Remove"
button.
<p>
Each freight car is associated with six pieces of information: its
reporting marks, whether the car is loaded or empty, the type of
freight car, the current cargo being carried, its current location, and
the freight car's "home division" for deciding when the car can be
used for a freight car load or for directing the car when empty.  You
can change any of these fields directly either by selecting or typing a
new value in the table, or using the text fields and pull down menus at the
bottom of the window.
<p>
The reporting marks are the initials and numbers on the freight car itself,
and will tell your operators which car to move.
<p>
The cargo indicates the contents which the car is carrying, or is
about to pick up.  The table of freight cars and the Cargo pull-down
menu at the bottom of the screen both only show the name of the cargo.
If you have several cargos all carrying "canned fruit", the name alone
won't tell you where a particular car of canned fruit is going.
However, if you hover your mouse over the name of the cargo, you can
get a longer description of the cargo: where the cargo is loaded and
unloaded, the kind of car that carries the cargo, and the number of
carloads per week.
<p>
The car type says what kind of freight car it is.  You can use
standard AAR car type codes, or define your own in
the <A HREF="pg23.html">Layout tab</a>.
<p>
The current location names where the freight car was last seen.  It
may currently be on a train, but will stay with the old location until
the train finishes its work.
<p>
The Home Division is used to identify whether a car should be used for
a given cargo and industry, and where an empty car should be returned.
When choosing a car to carry a particular load, only freight cars
whose home division matches the division of the source or destination
industry will be chosen.  If a freight car has no cargo, it will be
returned to a yard with the same division.
