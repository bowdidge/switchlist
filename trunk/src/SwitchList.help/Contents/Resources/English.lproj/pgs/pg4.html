<p>
SwitchList can draw the switchlist you give your crews in several
formats to match your preferences and prototype practice.  You can
select the preferred style in the Style tab for your layout.
Many switchlists also allow custom settings - places where you can insert
custom text to make your switchlist specific to your railroad.
<p>
If none of the standard switchlist styles match your railroad, you
can also design your own custom switchlists.  See links at the bottom
for details.
<UL>
<LI>Handwritten
<p>
<A HREF="../../shrd/bigtype.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/bigtype.jpg"></a>
I use the Handwritten switchlist on my own layout.  New crews working
in my somewhat dark garage found smaller type hard to read in the
conditions, especially for individuals heading towards needing
bifocals.
<p>
This switchlist uses a large typeface and removes all but the
necessary fields - which car is moving, where the car is coming from,
where it is going.  Whether the car is loaded and the actual contents
don't appear here.
<p>
The handwritten text and slight jitter in placement makes these look
like they've actually been compiled by your favorite conductor or yard
crew.  If you're modeling the 1930's, this will be much more
appropriate than something that looks typed or computer-printed.
<li>
Southern Pacific Narrow
<p>
<a href="../../shrd/spstyle.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/spstyle.jpg"></a>
This switchlist is inspired by actual Southern Pacific switchlists.
Like the Large Type switchlists, they look handwritten with jittery
fonts.  Make your crews think that you spent all night writing your
switchlists by hand!
<p>
This switchlist explicitly lists the contents of each car, and places
the origin to the right of the To field, just as on the prototype.
See Bill Kaufman's article on the San Francisco State Belt Railroad in
the July 2009 Railroad Model Craftsman for an example of a real
Southern Pacific switchlist.
<p>
In the custom settings, you can provide an alternate name for the railroad
at the top of the page.
<p>
<li>
Line Printer
<p>
My original switchlist, this one looks computer-generated and lists all the expected fields.
<p>
In the custom settings, you can provide an alternate name for the railroad
at the top of the page.
<li>PICL Report (contributed by James McNab)
<p>
<a href="../../shrd/picl.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/picl.jpg"></a></a>
<p>
The "Work Order" format is based off the PICL-style reports used by
most modern era (post-1980) railroad.  PICL, or Perpetual Inventory of
Car Locations, refers to a computer software program that lists the
standing of cars in order on each track.
<p>
These reports show the current status of each car at a given location,
track or industry.  Load Status, Blocking Instructions as well as
Commodity are common fields found on these reports.  Train crews use
these reports to plan their work, then report back to the train clerks
who update the PICL Inventory in a never-ending fashion.

The "Work Order" format shows the cars that the train will interact
with at each station stop along its route.  From left to right, the
fields are:
<br>
<b>Reporting Marks</b>
<br>
<b>Load or Empty (LE) Status</b>
<br>
<b>Blocking Instructions (Industry and Town)</b>
<br>
<b>Car Type or "Kind of Car" (KD)</b>
<br>
<b>Commodity</b>
<br>
<p>
The layout date and current time are appended to the end of the
report.  This style is best used on any modern era (post-1980) layout.
<p>
Since this format is based off computer-generated forms, character
limits do apply.
Car reporting marks are expected to be 11 characters or smaller; industry names
less than 21 characters; town names less than 21 characters; car types, two characters; and cargo descriptions: 15 characters.
Using names longer than these spaces can throw off the
formatting on a report.

<li>San Francisco Belt Railroad B7
<p>
<a href="../../shrd/b7.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/b7.jpg"></a></a>
The Southern Pacific Belt Railroad used an unusual set of paperwork for transferring cars
from the city's piers to the different railroads serving San Francisco.  Each business would file
a Form B-7 with the railroad describing the cars to be switched from one of the major railroad's yards
to the piers, and cars to be taken from the piers to the yards.  The Belt Railroad's crews would take these
forms as they switched each pier or industry.
Bill Kaufman goes into detail on the Form B-7 in his article in the July 2009 Railroad Model Craftsman magazine.
<p>
SwitchList's B-7 form imitates the Belt Railroad's paperwork.  Using this switchlist style in SwitchList requires
your layout to be set up in a specific way.  Each town on the railroad should represent a large major industry.
SwitchList will generate a separate B-7 for each industry/town, and list the cars to be taken to and removed from
each industry.  SwitchList will print one form for each town that a train stops at.
<p>
Cars being taken from the yard to the town/industry appear in the "SPOT AT" section; cars being taken from the industry
back to the yard appear in the "TAKE OUT" section.  If a car needs to be respotted to another industry/track in the same
town or in another town, a note will appear in the "notes" section.
<p>
SwitchList assumes that cars are being taken from and returned to the yard where the train starts.  The Form B-7 may
be unrealistic if your train stops at intermediate yards.
<p>
In the custom settings, you can provide an alternate name for the railroad
title and subtitle on the form.  Note that each page of the B-7 has a different
serial number.
<p>
<li>Railroad Letterhead (contributed by Glyn Thomas)</li>
<p>
<A HREF="../../shrd/railroad_letterhead.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/railroad_letterhead.jpg"></a>
<p>
Modern short lines resemble modern offices more than they resemble old-time
railroads, and their switchlists reflect that.  Railroad Letterhead
recreates the switching instructions typed by the general manager or owner
of the shortline on the office computer, and printed on an available piece
of company stationery.
<p>
Railroad Letterhead allows customizing four details of the switchlist:
the railroad name and subtitle/owner's name in the center, the railroad's
location to the left, and contact information to the right.  Each can contain
any text you like.  You can use HTML like you'd use to create a web page to
customize the content; "&lt;br&gt;" provides a line break to permit any of
these fields to draw as multiple lines.
<li>Waybill
<p>
<A HREF="../../shrd/waybill_style.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/waybill_style.jpg"></a>
<p>
The Waybill style is an experimental switchlist style that prints out
separate documents that reproduce the actual billing paperwork carried by
real railroads.  Waybills describe not only the car, its origin, and destination,
but the cargo, kind of car, and routing information.
<p>
To use the Waybill switchlist style, you can print out the individual waybills
and cut them out into individual pages.
The Waybill style cannot be customized from within SwitchList, but if you
have web development skills, you can modify the Waybill style to provide
realistic car routing instructions.
