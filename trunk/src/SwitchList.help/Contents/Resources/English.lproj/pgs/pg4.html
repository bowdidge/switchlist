SwitchList can draw the switchlist you give your crews in several formats to match your preferences and prototype practice.  You can select the preferred style in the Preferences dialog box.
<p>
Also check the links at the bottom for ways to customize these switchlists.
<UL>
<LI>Large Type
<p>
<A HREF="../../shrd/bigtype.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/bigtype.jpg"></a>
I use the Large Type switchlist on my own layout.  New crews working
in my somewhat dark garage found smaller type hard to read in the
conditions, especially for individuals heading towards needing
bifocals.
<p>
This switchlist uses a large typeface and removes all but the
necessary fields - which car is moving, where the car is coming from,
where it is going.  Whether the car is loaded and the actual contents
don't appear here.
<p>
The handwritten text and slight jitter in placement makes these look
like they've actually been compiled by your favorite conductor or yard
crew.  If you're modeling the 1930's, this will be much more
appropriate than something that looks typed or computer-printed.
<li>
Narrow Southern Pacific-style
<p>
<a href="../../shrd/spstyle.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/spstyle.jpg"></a>
This switchlist is inspired by actual Southern Pacific switchlists.
Like the Large Type switchlists, they look handwritten with jittery
fonts.  Make your crews think that you spent all night writing your
switchlists by hand!
<p>
This switchlist explicitly lists the contents of each car, and places
the origin to the right of the To field, just as on the prototype.
See Bill Kaufman's article on the San Francisco State Belt Railroad in
the July 2009 Railroad Model Craftsman for an example of a real
switchlist.
<p>
<li>
Traditional From/To
<p>
My original switchlist, this one looks computer-generated and lists all the expected fields.
<li>
Drop-off/Pick Up
<p>
Inspired by Bill Kaufman's switchlists for the State Belt Railroad,
this switch list names the cars to be taken from the yard, returned to
the yard, and moved separately.  I added this because I found some
crews had trouble reading the Large Type switchlist and understanding
which cars were going out, and which were going in.
<li>PICL Report (contributed by James McNab)
<p>
<a name="picl_report">
<a href="../../shrd/picl.jpg"><img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/picl.jpg"></a></a>

<p>
The "Work Order" format is based off the PICL-style reports used by
most modern era (post-1980) railroad.  PICL, or Perpetual Inventory of
Car Locations, refers to a computer software program that lists the
standing of cars in order on each track.
<p>
These reports show the current status of each car at a given location,
track or industry.  Load Status, Blocking Instructions as well as
Commodity are common fields found on these reports.  Train crews use
these reports to plan their work, then report back to the train clerks
who update the PICL Inventory in a never-ending fashion.

The "Work Order" format shows the cars that the train will interact
with at each station stop along its route.  From left to right, the
fields are:
<ul>
<li>Reporting Marks
<li>Load or Empty (LE) Status
<li>Blocking Instructions (Industry and Town)
<li>Car Type or "Kind of Car" (KD)
<li>Commodity
</ul>
<p>
The layout date and current time are appended to the end of the
report.  This style is best used on any modern era (post-1980) layout.
<p>
Since this format is based off computer-generated forms, character
limits do apply.
Car reporting marks are expected to be 11 characters or smaller; industry names
less than 21 characters; town names less than 21 characters; car types, two characters; and cargo descriptions: 15 characters.
Using names longer than these spaces can throw off the
formatting on a report.
<p>
</ul>
