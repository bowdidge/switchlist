<h1>Detail: Layout Balance and Unavailable Cars</h1>
</div>
<div id="leftspace">
<p>
One of the harder parts of setting up any car movement scheme - switchlists, car
cards, colored thumbtacks, or just writing up random switchlists off the top of your
head - is getting the right balance of cars moving to match your
imagined scheme.
If you want a particular industry to have lots of cars flowing in and out, and another
to be quiet, you need to make sure that your car movement scheme generates the
right number of movements, and that your freight car fleet has the needed cars
available.
<p>
<h2>Defining the Right Cargos for Your Layout</h2>
<p>
With SwitchList, you adjust balance primarily by specifying the cargos that should
be carried.  Each cargo lets you specify how many loads per week should be
transported on average.  If you say that a cannery should receive three cars a 
week of empty cans, then (roughly) every other session, a carload should
arrive.  Because SwitchList chooses loads randomly from the cargos you provide,
the car of cans might not arrive for two sessions, or two cars might arrive on the
same day.  This randomness ensures that your operating sessions don't become
too repetitive.
<p>
When adding cargos, think about how many cars per day the industry track can hold,
the ratio of incoming raw materials to outgoing finished products, and the
sorts of freight cars you want visiting the industry.  One quick way to look at
the cargos visiting the industry is to switch to the <A HREF="pg27.html">Cargos tab</a>
and select the "Source" or "Destination" column headers to sort and group the cargos
for that industry.  (You can also use the Search field in the tab to search for
all cargos with a specific name to see, for example, how many cars of cans are
sent to other industries.)
<p>
The <A HREF="pg5.html">Cargo Report</a> may also be useful for balancing cargos.
The Cargo report lists the total number of incoming and outgoing car loads,
broken down by industry and type of freight car.  If you expect Cannery A to have
twice as much business as cannery B, then the Cargo Report
can help you see if Cannery B truly has only half the business.
<p>
<H2>Unavailable Cars</H2>
<p>
The second way to affect layout balance is to make sure that you have the needed
freight cars to carry all those loads.
When you start a new operating session or generate additional loads to fill,
the  <A HREF="pg28.html">Overview Tab</a> shows a status message at the bottom
describing how many freight cars on the layout are reserved for or carrying a particular
cargo, and how many loads couldn't be carried because of unavailable freight cars.
<p>
<pre>
110 freight cars, 97 assigned, 8 at workbench
Unavailable cars: (type/number): RS (3), XM (2), FM (1)
</pre>
<p>
In the case above, SwitchList's status tells us that we have 110
freight cars defined, and 97 of those either are carrying a cargo or
are routed to pick up a cargo.  Of the 13 cars that don't have a
cargo, eight are at the Workbench for repairs.  The remaining cars
do not have a cargo assigned because there are no cargos for them to
carry.  This could be random luck (no such cargos were randomly chosen
today), the freight cars might have the wrong division (east coast boxcars for
loads destined for the west coast), 
there may be too many freight cars for the cargos you've
specified, or the freight car could be a type that only infrequently
carries cargos.
<p>
The second line tells us about the opposite problem - cases where a freight
car load was randomly picked, but no cars were available.  In this case,
there were three refrigerator car loads that couldn't be assigned today
because no refrigerator cars were free.  Similarly, there were boxcar (XM)
and flatcar (FM) loads that couldn't be carried because of a lack of cars.
This may or may
not be a problem.  If you want all your freight cars moving all the time, you
can make the "loads per week" very high so that there's always loads to fill
your freight cars.  If you're trying to have the cargo "loads per week" match
real expectations about how many cars should arrive and depart, then this might
hint that you don't have enough freight cars for the loads you want to carry.
