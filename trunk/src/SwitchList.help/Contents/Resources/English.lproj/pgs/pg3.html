<p>
To use SwitchList, just follow the following steps:
<ol>
<li> Start SwitchList.
<p>
Before an operating session, start up the program and open the SwitchList document for your layout.
<li> Check cars are in correct locations.
<p>
To double-check that all cars are in their correct locations, print out an Industry Report to list where the cars are supposed to be, and reposition the cars or change where SwitchList thinks the car is.
<p>
All the reports for printing out the state of the layout can be generated by selecting one of the menu items in the Reports menu.  All display a window containing the report; you then use the Print command from the File menu to print out a physical page.
<li> Load and unload cars that have been sitting.
<p>
In the Overview window, press "load/unload all cars" to load and unload all cars that are at their destination.
<li> Choose some new loads to carry.
<p>
 Choose the number of new freight car load requests to generate for this session.  Press "Generate loads".  This both creates the cargos and assigns them to available freight cars.
<li>
Print a switchlist.
<p>
Select a train, and press "Make Switchlist" to see which cars were
assigned.  (You can also double-click on a train to have the
switchlist appear.)  Cars are sorted in the order they'd be picked
up.  Print the switch list by choosing Print from the file menu.
<li>
Get your yardmaster sorting.
<p>
Print out the yard report listing which cars are assigned to each train. Set up your trains in staging, or give the report to yard crews so they can make up each train.
<li> Operate your model railroad!
<p>
Run trains, switch boxcars, and get those cars to the right destinations!
<li> Clean up.
<p>
When the train finishes switching, select the train name and press "Train Completed" to remember that the cars have been moved.  Remember to save your layout description so car positions will be remembered the next time you run!
