<p>
SwitchList is a Macintosh program for generating model railroad switchlists and randomly choosing the work that a model railroad crew will do.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Optimized for Small Layouts Focused on Switching
<p>
SwitchList is best suited for smaller layouts without elaborate train schedules or complex yards.</p>
<p>
<a href="pg11.html">In Depth: Which Layouts are Best for Switchlist?</a>
<p>
<li>Improvements Over Car Cards.
<p>
SwitchList generates a random set of new waybills per session.  Not
all cars will be moving every session, and cars shouldn't repeat
paths.  Car types are customizable so you can easily specify that only
certain boxcars are suitable for certain loads.
To make switching more realistic and complex, you can also specify that certain industries require cars to be placed at specific doors.
You can also declare that certain cars will take more than one day to unload, requiring them to be moved out of the way when switching other cars.
<p>
<li>Realistic, Easy to Read Paperwork
<a name="SwitchList_MAIN"></a>
<p>
SwitchList generates operating paperwork that looks like the real
thing.  You'll no longer cringe when your 1930's railroad uses
dot-matrix printers to tell crews what work is to be done.  You can
easily generate several kinds of reports and lists - lists of which
cars are at which industries, instructions for yardmasters on which
cars to place together, tabulate the number of loads arriving or
leaving from an industry.
<p>
<a href="pg4.html">Styles of SwitchList paperwork</a>
<p>
<li>Simple and Easy to Use
<p>
SwitchList is a native Macintosh application, so it works like the other
programs you're already used to.  Our goal is to keep the user interface
and feature set simpler so you can spend more time operating trains and
less trying to understand the program's behavior.
<p>
SwitchList runs on any Macintosh computer running Mac OS X 10.5 or greater.  The SwitchList application will run on PowerPC or Intel computers.
<p>
<li>Write Your Own Switch List Styles
<p>
SwitchList lets you create your own templates describing how your switch list paperwork should look - realistic,
