SwitchList's use of divisions is inspired by the FreightCarForwarder program written by Robert Heller.
<p>
The Database bits of SwitchList were written using Apple's CoreData framework,
and was much easier to implement and maintain as a result.  Check it out for
your next project.
<p>
The "Large Type" version of the switchlist was suggested by an operator
on my layout who suggested that using tiny typewriter fonts in a dark
garage would force my operators to pull out their bifocals.
<p>
I've had several operators ask me how I ever hand-lettered the switchlists
so neatly.  Thanks for making me happy I took the time to make the switchlists
look better.
<h2>Open Souce Projects Used by SwitchList</h2>
<p>
Parts borrowed from other open-source project helped make SwitchList better than I could
have done on my own.
<p>
The "View Switchlists on iPad" feature was implemented with Cultured Code's SimpleHTTPServer code fragment.
It's available at <A HREF="http://culturedcode.com/cocoa">http://culturedcode.com/cocoa</a>.
<p>
Matt Gallagher's NSFileManager+DirectoryLocations code helps me find user-generated switch list templates.
<p>
<a HREF="http://mattgemmell.com/">Matt Gemmell's</a>
<a HREF="http://mattgemmell.com/2008/05/20/mgtemplateengine-templates-with-cocoa">MGTemplateEngine</a> code
generates the web switchlists from user-customizable templates.
John Engelhart's <A HREF="http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/">RegexKit</a> is also a needed part of MGTemplateEngine.

<h2>SwitchList Contributors</h2>
<p>
James McNab created the PICL Reports; thank him if you're trying to generate
switchlists appropriate for modern railroading!
