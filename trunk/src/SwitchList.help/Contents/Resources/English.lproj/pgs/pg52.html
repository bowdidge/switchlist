<H1>Detail: Importing Lists of Freight Cars from Other Programs</h1>

<p>
You can
import lists of freight cars from a text file on your computer using
the Import cars... menu item on the File menu; this can avoid some of
the tedious typing if you have a list handy in another program or in a
spreadsheet.
<p>
Create a text file with each freight car's reporting marks on a
separate line.  You can also include the freight car type on the same
line separated from the reporting marks by a comma or tab.  Here's an
example file for importing:
<p>
<pre>
SP&S 2001, XM
SP 94844, GS
SP 20756
WM 20012, XA
</pre>
