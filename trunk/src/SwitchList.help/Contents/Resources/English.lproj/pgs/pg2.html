<h1>Setting Up a Layout With SwitchList</h1>
</div>
<div id="leftspace">
<p>
To operate switchlists, you need to be able to name the towns on your
railroad, the industries in those towns, the freight cars that will be
delivered to those industries, the trains carrying the freight cars,
and the cargos inside those cars.
<p>
That may seem intimidating, but you don't have to type in all
information on every freight car or town to try out SwitchList.
Instead, just name a few cars, a couple industries, and a single train
at first.  Fill in the remaining cars as you go.  Add or remove cargos
as you consider what your trains might carry.  You can add, remove, or
change any item at any time.
<h2>To set up your layout in SwitchList</h2>
<p>
<ol id="tasklistnumbered">
<li> Add freight cars.
<p>
Go to the Freight Car tab and enter
the information for some of your freight cars.  Press "Add" to create
a new freight car, then type in some of the details of the car.  At
first, you only need to enter the "reporting marks" - the initials and
car number ("SP 21594", "PENN 593021").  Later, you can add the car type,
divisions, and the like.
<p>
For now, just type in a few freight cars of the same type - all boxcars
or hoppers. That way, you can enter only a few cargos and test that these
cars carry the cargo around.

<p>
<li>Create a town.
<p>
Go to the Towns tab and name the major places on your layout.  Places
that are hidden such as hidden yards and staging tracks should be
labeled as "staging".
<p>
<A HREF="pg25.html">User Interface: Towns Tab</a>
<p>
<A HREF="pg101.html">Learn more about staging.</a>
<p>
<A HREF="pg102.html">Learn more about offline towns.</a>
<li> Name the industries on your layout.
<p>
Industries can be multi-track
locations ("Chemical Plant") or just part of a track ("Car Plant Scrap Track").
You only want to specify enough to help your train crews know where cars go.

<p>
<A HREF="pg104.html">What counts as an industry?</a>
<li> Create a yard.
<p>
Create a yard to indicate where trains start.  Yards can either be hidden
in staging, or a physical place on the layout.  All trains must start and
end in a town with a yard.
<p>
<A HREF="pg22.html">User Interface: Yards Tab</a>
<p>
<li> Create a train.
<p>
Create a single train for now that visits all the towns.
<p>
<A HREF="pg26.html">User Interface: Trains Tab</a>
<p>
<li>
Create a few cargos.
<p>
Choose an industry, identify a likely item being sent or received from it, and type in the needed fields.
<p>

<p>
<LI>Now run the train.
<p>
Go back to the Overview tab, press x buttons, print a switchlist.  Look ok?
