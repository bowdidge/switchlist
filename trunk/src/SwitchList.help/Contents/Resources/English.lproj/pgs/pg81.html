This is my model railroad; it models a Southern Pacific branch in San
Jose, CA.  Most of the industries are related to fruit and orchards -
canneries, dried fruit packing houses, and box factories.  There are two major
staging yards on each end, several towns in-between, and an
interchange track for the Western Pacific (which is modeled as if it
were a staging yard.)
<p>
<h2>Use of Multiple Industries in Same Industry Area</h2>
The Vasona Branch has a few large industries that are represented by
multiple "industries" in SwitchList.
Plant 51, for example, has two parallel six car tracks.  It is treated
as two separate industries - ten cars worth of capacity for boxcars, with
two spots at the end of one track labelled as "Plant 51 Oil" and used for
heating oil deliveries.  Pumping and hoses near the spot can highlight the
different purpose for the location.
<p>

<p>
The picture to the right shows Plant 51's door #1.  The doors are numbered
right-to-left 1-6 on the far track, and 7-10 on the near track.  The
rightmost two spots on the near track are the Del Monte Oil tracks.
<p>
The Del Monte Cannery plant also uses multiple industries to encourage
the operator to see the different work being done at the plant, and
complicate the switching work.  The Del Monte In industry is intended
for incoming deliveries, and sits at one end of the Plant.  The Del
Monte Out and Del Monte Oil industries share the same tracks; the Del
Monte Out industry gets all the boxcars for finished goods, while the
Del Monte Oil spots handle oil tank cars for fuel oil.  The Oil spots
are just the last spots on two parallel tracks; a map on the fascia
explains the spotting locations to the operator.  The Del Monte Spur
track handles occasional special traffic and points the opposite way
of all the other tracks, encouraging the operator to switch that track
separately.  The Del Monte Storage track is a bit of track that's
normally unused, but is a common place for off-spotting cars that
won't fit at their official place.  Providing a separate industry for
the off-spot allows me to mark that the car is in an incorrect space,
and let operators at the next session correctly spot the car.
<h2>Use of Doors</h2>
<a href="../../shrd/plant51.jpeg">
<img class="floatRight" src="../../shrd/plant51.jpeg"></a>
Several industries on the  Vasona Branch require freight cars to be
spotted at specific doors: Plant 51, Del Monte Out, and the Ainsley Cannery.
For the Ainsley Cannery, the four doors are in a line on the same spur
track, but Plant 51 and Del Monte Out's doors are split across multiple
tracks.  A map on the layout fascia explain to the programmer where
each door is located.  Plant 51 has ten "doors" on two parallel 6 car capacity
tracks, with doors 1-6 on the track closest to the plant, and 7-10 on the next
track out.
<p>
<h2>Use of Divisions in the Vasona Branch Example</h2>
Although most cars enter and leave the layout through San Jose Yard,
divisions encourage a couple other exit points.
The WP Interchange yard in Auzerais St. only accepts empty WP cars (both
because its division is WP, and because it only accepts cars from the WP
division.) 
<p>
The San Jose yard is in the SP division, so it's an appropriate destination
for empty SP cars, but because it accepts cars from all the divisions -
SP, East, Mid, and WP - it will accept all empty freight cars.  Because it's
a staging yard, empty cars from any railroad touching San Jose Yard are
assumed to reach their final home.
<p>
The Santa Cruz yard only accepts SP cars, so it's not an appropriate exit
for non-SP cars.  Non-SP cars do get routed to the Santa Cruz yard because
several industries pretending to be located in Santa Cruz Yard ship to the
East Coast, and can use eastbound empties to carry the loads.
<p>
The Vasona Staging yard is irrelevant for now; no freight trains stop there.
In real life, some trains came from Vasona Staging and went to San Jose Yard
(and vice-versa), so having Vasona Staging accept all divisions would allow
east-coast cars to exit in that direction.
